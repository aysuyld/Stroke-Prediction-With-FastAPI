Hello Connections,

I've completed a data science project and I'd like to share it with you! This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the risk of stroke and making this model accessible through a web service.

As a first step, I conducted a comprehensive data analysis on a health dataset. I cleaned missing data, examined the distribution of features, and addressed class imbalances. Then, I built a prediction model using various machine learning algorithms.

After training the model, I made it accessible through a FastAPI application. This allows users to quickly and easily predict the risk of stroke based on entered health data.

The results were quite positive. The model I created can accurately predict the risk of stroke based on specific health data. This could play a significant role in detecting and preventing future stroke cases.
